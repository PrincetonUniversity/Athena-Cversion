\section{Introduction}

{\it Athena} is a grid-based code for astrophysical gas dynamics
developed with support of the NSF Information Technology Research (ITR)
program.  This {\it Programmer's Guide} describes version 3.0 (hereafter
referred to as \ath); the third publicly released version of the code.
This guide is intended as a very basic introduction into the data structures
and organization of \ath, it will be useful to any user interested in
modifying or extending the code.  The {\it User's Guide} should be consulted
for directions on how to install, configure, compile, and run \ath.

\section{The Computational Grid}

Figure~\ref{f:grid} diagrams the transformation between the continuous
spatial dimensions $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $x_{3}$ and the discrete
coordinates $i,j,k$.  The origin of the computational domain has the
coordinates $(x1\_0, x2\_0, x3\_0)$ in the continuous coordinates.
These need not be the same as the origin $(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}) = (0,0,0)$.
The discrete coordinate system is indexed by the integers $(ix1, ix2,
ix3)$.  The origin of the discrete coordinates $(ix1,ix2,ix3) = (0,0,0)$
is located at $(x1\_0,x2\_0,x3\_0)$).  The computational domain can be
further subdivided into patches; each patch is offset from the origin
of the discrete coordinate system by an integer number of grid cells
$(idisp, jdisp, kdisp)$.  The grid coordinates within a given patch
are referenced to the location of the point $(idisp, jdisp, kdisp)$
(which is treated as the origin for {\em that} patch).  The first active
cell in the grid has the coordinates $(is,js,ks)$, which are all equal
to the number of ghost cells used to specify the boundary conditions,
that is $is=js=ks=nghost$.  The last active cell in each dimension is
labeled by $i=ie$, $j=je$, and $k=ke$.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\plotone_reduction{figure1.eps}{0.9}
\caption{Relation between the continuous spatial dimensions $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$
and the discrete coordinates $i,j$ in a two-dimensional slice
at a fixed value of $x_{3}$ ($k$) in \ath.  The relations in the 
$x_{2}-x_{3}$ and $x_{1}-x_{3}$ planes are identical.
See the text for details.}
\label{f:grid}
\end{figure}

Mathematically, the spatial coordinate of the {\em center} of any grid point
on the mesh is given by
\begin{displaymath}
  x1_{i} = x1\_0 + (i + idisp - 0.5)*(\Delta x1)
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  x2_{j} = x2\_0 + (j + jdisp - 0.5)*(\Delta x2)
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  x3_{k} = x3\_0 + (k + kdisp - 0.5)*(\Delta x3)
\end{displaymath}
where $\Delta x1$, $\Delta x2$, and $\Delta x3$ are the grid spacing
on the patch.  These formulae are implemented in the function {\tt
cc\_pos.c}.  The use of patches and the offsets $(idisp, jdisp, kdisp)$ are
useful for nested grids, or tiling a single grid on parallel processors.

Figure~\ref{f:gridcell} shows the centering of variables within a cell
on the computational grid.  The vector {\bf U} stores volume-averaged
values of the conserved variables (density, momentum, total energy, and
cell centered magnetic field).  The fundamental representation of the
magnetic field are the {\em area-averaged} components stored at cell faces. 
We label the {\em left} interface value with the same index as the cell-center.

conserved variables at cell centers.}

\section{Data Structures}

The entire computational domain is divided into grid blocks.  Each block
represents a patch of the domain updated by a separate processor (for
calculations on parallel systems), or
a region in which the grid is refined (for nested or adaptive grids), or
both.  Data is organized in the following C structures (defined in 
the header file {\tt athena.h}).

\subsection{The Domain Structure}

Information about the entire computational domain is stored in the
Domain structure, reproduced below.
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct Grid_Block_s{
  int ixs, jxs, kxs;             /* Minimum coordinate of cells in this block */
  int ixe, jxe, kxe;             /* Maximum coordinate of cells in this block */
  int my_id;                     /* process ID (rank in MPI) */
}Grid_Block;


typedef struct Domain_s{
  Grid_Block ***grid_block;     /* 3D array of grid blocks tiling this domain */
  int ixs, jxs, kxs;        /* Minimum coordinate of cells over entire domain */
  int ixe, jxe, kxe;        /* Maximum coordinate of cells over entire domain */
}Domain;
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Note the Domain contains an array of Grid\_Blocks, which in turn contain
information about the coordinates of that patch in the continuous space
(see \S2.1).

\subsection{The Grid Structure}

We organize the information about each grid patch in the Domain,
as well as the dependent
variables on that patch, into a C structure called a Grid.  The dependent
variables {\em at cell center} are organized into another C structure we
call Gas.  Thus, a Grid contains the Gas structure, the face centered
magnetic field, plus information about coordinates.
The Grid structure is reproduced below.
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct Grid_s{
  Gas ***U;                     /* pointer to a 3D array of Gas'es */
#ifdef MHD
  Real ***B1i,***B2i,***B3i;    /* pointer to a 3D array of interface B's */
#endif /* MHD */
  Real x1_0;                    /* x1-position of coordinate ix = 0 */
  Real x2_0;                    /* x2-position of coordinate jx = 0 */
  Real x3_0;                    /* x3-position of coordinate kx = 0 */
  Real dx1,dx2,dx3;             /* cell size */
  Real dt,time;                 /* time step, absolute time */
  int nstep;                    /* number of integration steps taken */
  int Nx1,Nx2,Nx3;              /* number of zones in x1, x2, x3 direction */
  int is,ie;                    /* start/end cell index in x1 direction */
  int js,je;                    /* start/end cell index in x2 direction */
  int ks,ke;                    /* start/end cell index in x3 direction */
  int idisp;                    /* coordinate ix = index i + idisp */
  int jdisp;                    /* coordinate jx = index j + jdisp */
  int kdisp;                    /* coordinate kx = index k + kdisp */
  char *outfilename;            /* basename for output files */
  int my_id;                /* process ID (or rank in MPI) updating this Grid */
  int nproc;                /* total number of processes in the calculation */
  int rx1_id, lx1_id;       /* ID of grids to R/L in x1-dir (default = -1) */
  int rx2_id, lx2_id;       /* ID of grids to R/L in x2-dir (default = -1) */
  int rx3_id, lx3_id;       /* ID of grids to R/L in x3-dir (default = -1) */
}Grid;
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Note that both the Gas structure and the face-centered fields are
3D arrays.  The advantage of making the cell centered variables a 3D
array of type Gas, rather than making the Gas structure itself contain
3D arrays, is that we guarantee that different variables at the same
grid cell will be stored contiguously in memory, which can improve cache
performance.

\subsection{The Gas Structure}

The Gas structure stores cell centered values of each of the
dependent variables, it is defined in {\tt athena.h} and
reproduced below.

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}

typedef struct Gas_s{
  Real d;                       /* density */
  Real M1;                      /* Momenta in 1,2,3.  Use 1,2,3 to label */
  Real M2;                      /* directions in anticipation of         */
  Real M3;                      /* covariant coordinate in future        */
#ifndef ISOTHERMAL
  Real E;                       /* Total energy density */
#endif /* ISOTHERMAL */
#ifdef MHD
  Real B1c;                     /* cell centered magnetic fields in 1,2,3 */
  Real B2c;
  Real B3c;
#endif /* MHD */
}Gas;

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The vector {\bf M} denotes the linear momentum.
Note the Gas structure contains all 3 components of the cell-centered
magnetic field, that is it contains 8 variables in all.
The longitudinal component of the field is dropped in the one-dimensional
system of equations; we define new structures for the dependent variable
in one-dimension, each of which only contains 7 variables.
For the conserved variables, the structure is Cons1D

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}

typedef struct Cons1D_s{
  Real d;                       /* density */
  Real Mx;                      /* Momenta in X,Y,Z.  Use X,Y,Z now instead  */
  Real My;                      /* of 1,2,3 since this structure can contain */
  Real Mz;                      /* a slice in any dimension: 1,2,or 3        */
#ifndef ISOTHERMAL
  Real E;                       /* Total energy density */
#endif /* ISOTHERMAL */
#ifdef MHD
  Real By;                      /* cell centered magnetic fields in Y,Z */
  Real Bz;
#endif /* MHD */
}Cons1D;

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

while for the primitive variables the structure is Prim1D

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}

typedef struct Prim1D_s{
  Real d;                       /* density */
  Real Vx;                      /* Velocity in X,Y,Z */
  Real Vy;
  Real Vz;
#ifndef ISOTHERMAL
  Real P;                       /* pressure */
#endif /* ISOTHERMAL */
#ifdef MHD
  Real By;                      /* cell centered magnetic fields in Y,Z */
  Real Bz;
#endif /* MHD */
}Prim1D;

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Note that we have used the subscripts x,y, and z to denote the components
of vectors in the one-dimensional variables contained in Cons1D and
Prim1D, whereas we used the subscripts 1,2, and 3 to denote the components
of vectors in the Gas structure.  The variables in the Gas structure
are fixed with respect to the coordinates of the grid (e.g., {\tt M1}
corresponds to the momentum in the 1-direction).  However, since the
one-dimensional variables may represent a slice in any direction, the
x,y, and z components are not fixed with respect to the grid (that is,
{\tt Mx} corresponds to {\tt M1} along an a slice in the 1-direction,
but {\tt Mx} corresponds to {\tt M2} along an a slice in the 2-direction).

The order of the variables in the Gas, Prim1d, and Cons1D structures is
extremely important and
cannot be changed for several reasons.  Firstly, this order determines the
order of the elements used in the eigensystem of the linearized equations
(computed in the functions contained in the files {\tt esystem\_prim.c}
and {\tt esystem\_roe.c}).  Secondly, in several functions we set a
pointer to the first element in the structure, and then address successive
elements (variables) by incrementing the pointer, as in the
following code fragment from the function {\tt lr\_states\_prim2.c}

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}

    pWl = (Real *) &(Wl[i+1]);

    qx = 0.5*MAX(ev[NWAVE-1],0.0)*dtodx;
    for (n=0; n<NWAVE; n++) {
      pWl[n] = Wrv[n] - qx*dW[n];
    }

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Here, {\tt Wl}, {\tt Wrv}, and {\tt dW} are all structures of type Prim1D,
and {\tt NWAVE} is the number of components of these structures (which
depends on whether the problem is hydrodynamic or MHD, and adiabatic or
isothermal).  Using pointers in this way leads to more compact coding,
is more efficient (since it allows vectorization of the loop), and by
using structures to ensure the components of the vectors are stored
contiguously, it is more cache efficient.  However, {\em be warned!}.
It also means the order of the variables is hardwired in the code,
and cannot be changed, which has the potential to be the source of some
nasty bugs.

\section{Memory Allocation and Management}

{\tt Athena3.0} uses dynamic memory allocation, meaning that all arrays must be
created at run time using {\tt malloc} or {\tt calloc}.  This makes the
coding slightly more complex, but has the great advantage that problems
of different dimensions (1D, 2D, or 3D), and problems of different sizes
can be run without the need for recompiling.

The indexing convention used in \ath\ is that all multidimensional
arrays must have the $x1$ index as the fastest incrementing index.
In this way, data in cell $i-1$ should be contiguous with data in cell
$i$, whereas data in cell $j-1$ will be $Nx1 + 2*nghost$ data elements
away from the data in cell $j$, and the data in cell $k-1$ will be
$(Nx1 + 2*nghost)*(Nx2 + 2*nghost)$ data elements away from the data in
cell $k$.  In order to achieve this in C, arrays must be referenced as
{\tt A[k][j][i]}.  The file {\tt real\_array.c} contains functions for
creating (allocating) and destroying (deallocating) 2D and 3D arrays.

Recall (from \S2.1) that on each grid patch, the first active zone is
labeled $is$ and the last is labeled $ie$ (similarly for $js$ and $je$, 
and $ks$ and $ke$).  Thus, to stride across all active zones requires
triply nested {\tt for} loops:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}

  for (k=ks; k<=ke; k++) {
    for (j=js; j<=je; j++) {
      for (i=is; i<=ie; i++) {
        ....
      }
    }
  }

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Note the inner loop should always be over the $i$-index.

\section{Code Structure}

The main integration loop is contained in {\tt main.c}, which all
initializes the domain and grid patches, and orchestrates I/O.  Which
integrator is actually used is determined by a function pointer
set at runtime by {\tt integrate\_init()} in the file {\tt integrate.c}.

The 1D, 2D, and 3D integrators are very different in structure.
However, much effort has been put into keeping them as modular as
possible.  Thus, they all share the same reconstruction functions (e.g., {\tt
lr\_states\_prim2.c}, etc.) and flux functions (e.g., {\tt flux\_roe.c},
etc.).  Eigensystems in the conserved and primitive variables, needed by
some of the Riemann solvers and reconstruction algorithms respectively,
are contained in the {\tt esystem\_roe.c} and {\tt esystem\_prim.c} files.

The input file is parsed by the functions in {\tt par.c}, and I/O
is coordinated by the functions in {\tt output.c}.

Users who wish to make substantial modification or extension of
the algorithms should start by understanding the 1D integrator ({\tt
integrate\_1d.c}) and the functions it calls, before moving on to the 2D
and 3D integrators.

\section{Final Words about Code Development}

We have used mostly the GNU development tools (gmake, gcc, autoconf)
to develop the code.  It should work on any platform that supports
these tools (although experience shows that undoubtedly there will be some
machines for which it {\em will} fail).   To date we have tested the
code on Linux, Solaris, and MacOSX.

Coding style is very personal and has been the source of many animated
discussions at Caf\'{e} Nero and Small World Coffee.  We have only agreed
on the following: we recommend the default emacs style (for example,
indenting by 2 as in K\&R style).
